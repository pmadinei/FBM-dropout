# A highly customizable Fractional Brownian Motion Dropout algorithm inspired by brain's serotonergic system

This algorithm simulates Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM) agents on a rectangular plane with equal
relative spacing between squares. The class determines the size of the squares based on
    the values of 'plane_size', 'grid_shape', and 'neuron_spacing'. It also adds a border
    around the rectangle plane with a width of square edge / 2. The class generates 'n_fibers'
    number of random coordinates in the rectangle and simulates an FBM agent from each
    coordinate with a Hurst exponent of 'hurst'. The time of each FBM path is set to 'T'.
    The class uses standard FBM (Ïƒ = 1) and sets the time-distance between two consecutive
    points in FBM paths to 'deltaT'. The length of the moving fiber, in points, is set to
    'fiber_length' and the speed (offset) of fibers in each iteration, in points, is set to
    'fiber_speed'. The factor that translates the FBM-path coordinates to the rectangle
    coordinates (fbmToRec) is also set.
